#OpenCartDemo
"OpencartDemo" is a feature-rich e-commerce website that includes all the standard functionalities typically found in online shopping platforms. Using this website, I have developed a Hybrid Test Automation Framework from scratch, utilizing Selenium WebDriver, Java, and TestNG for efficient and scalable test execution.

Technologies used:
Selenium Webdriver : For interacting with webBrowsers
Java               : Coding language
TestNG             : For organizing test cases, implement parallel execution, to generate standard HTML reports
ExtentReport       : For generating user friendly and efficient reports
Log4j              : For logging the test info/logs

Folder Structure:
**src\test\java\PageObjects**   : Contains all the page objects and their interactions for corresponding web page

**src\test\java\TestBase**      : Contains base class which has driver initiation & teardown methods

**src\test\java\TestCases **    : Contais all test cases/ scenario based test cases
**src\test\java\Utilities**     : Contains all the common used methods
**src\test\resources**          : Contains test data files / configuration files
